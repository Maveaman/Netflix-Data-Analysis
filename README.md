# Netflix-Data-Analysis

## Project Overview

This repository presents the findings from an extensive analysis of Netflix data aimed at uncovering viewer behaviors, content trends, and strategic insights to optimize content strategies and enhance user experience on the platform.

## Objectives

- **Improve Data Quality:** Through cleaning and normalization.
- **Analyze Genre Preferences and Director Contributions**
- **Provide Actionable Insights:** For strategic decision-making at Netflix.

## Scope

The project encompasses data collection, cleaning, preparation, storage, and in-depth analysis using SQL queries to address key business questions related to content production, audience engagement, and operational efficiency.

## Data Collection and Loading

### Data Sources

- A comprehensive Netflix dataset containing information about movies, TV shows, directors, genres, countries, duration, and ratings.

### Data Loading Process

- Imported data into Python for initial preprocessing and then transferred it to SQL Server for storage and subsequent analysis.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

### Handling Foreign Characters

- Modified the data type of the "Title" column to 'nvarchar' to accommodate foreign characters.

### Removing Duplicates

- Implemented procedures to eliminate duplicate entries, enhancing data integrity and reliability.

### Data Type Conversions

- Converted the "Date Added" column from varchar to date for consistent date handling and analysis.

### Populating Missing Values

- Utilized the director column to populate missing values in the "Country" column.
- Corrected misattributed values in the "Duration" column using a CASE statement.

### Creating Separate Tables for Multi-Value Columns

- Established separate tables for multi-value attributes such as "Listed In," "Director," "Country," and "Cast" to optimize data organization and querying efficiency.

## Data Storage and Management

### Raw Data Layer

- Stored initial data imports for preservation and future reference.

### Final Staging Layer

- Maintained cleaned and transformed data, prepared for detailed analysis and reporting.
